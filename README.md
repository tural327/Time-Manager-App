# Time Manager App

When I read vlog releted with time management I liked one article which was strategy of time management like work 30 minutes and rest for 5 minutes (Elon Musk and etc. talk about it) then I decided build web app for that.

# Software
- App developed Ubuntu 20.04 
- Python 3.8
- Pyqt5

# How does it works ? ...

When you run code or app you will firslt see first main page right side showing your local time and sliders

You need just select your working and resting minutes by using slider (max work min is 90 max rest is 15 ) then push Start now your time manager is working !

After pushing start button you will see this :
